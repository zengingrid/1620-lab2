    <p>Hello, welcome to my page!</p> 

    <p>My name is Ingrid and my friends call me Inggy.</p> 

    <p>I have a passion for food and my favourite times are spent in the kitchen while cooking or baking.
        When I'm not at home, I love going on trips or just out with friends doing cafe hopping. 
        (Because I worked as a barista for 6 years, I am judgemental about the quality of my coffee).
        For the last 6 months, COVID has dramatically reduced my time outside.
        Therefore, I spend most of my spare time learning Guitar and French.</p> 
        
    <p>Before the CIT program, I studied Nutritional Science at UBC. 
        (I am somewhat health conscious, but I am still a fan of instant noodle.)
        After graduation in 2018, I worked for a year at an NGO.
        I liked the admin aspect of the job, along with design and marketing.
        It has inspired me to return to school, and further develop myself.
        I hope to find a job one day, that allows me to travel around the world.</p>

    <p>Now you know a little about me :) </p>
