    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="image of inggy.jpg" width="230" height="280" alt="photo of inggy">
    <p>Hello, welcome to my page! </p> 

    <p>My name is Ingrid and I am a student at BCIT.</p> 

    <p>My biggest passion is food and my favourite times are spent in the kitchen while cooking or baking.
        When I'm not at home, I enjoy going on trips or just hanging out with friends. 
        We love cafe hopping together! Since I worked for 6 years as a barista,
        a good cup of coffee makes me happy.</p> 
        
    <p>Before the CIT program, I studied Nutritional Science at UBC. 
        (I am somewhat health conscious, but I am still a fan of instant ramen.)
        After graduation in 2018, I worked for a year at an NGO.
        I liked the admin aspect of the job, along with design and marketing.
        It has inspired me to return to school, and further develop myself.
        I hope to find a job one day, that allows me to travel around the world.</p>

    <p>Now you know a little about me :) </p>
